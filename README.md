#We present the Queensland Twin IMaging (QTIM) dataset: a multimodal neuroimaging dataset of young adult twins and #siblings (18-30 years, N = 1026), including a subsample of participants, scanned a second time to assess test-retest #reliability (N = 78, test-retest interval ~ 3.5 months). The QTAB dataset additionally includes adolescent twins #scanned at age 12 (N = 88) or 16 (N = 88) years. Approximately a third of these 12- and 16-year-old participants were #scanned four years later as part of a longitudinal pilot study (scanned at 12 and 16 years N = 24, scanned at 16 and #20 years N = 38).

#The Queensland Twin Adolescent Brain Project, a longitudinal study of adolescent brain development. Manuscript #submitted for publication. 
#When acknowledging the QTAB project studies should consider including the following: 
  #The QTAB project resource was produced as a result of i) the goodwill and contribution of 422 twin/triplet #participants and their parents, 
  #ii) funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council, Australia (APP1078756) and the Queensland Brain #Institute, University of Queensland,
  #iii) access to several key resources, including the Centre for Advanced Imaging, the Human Studies Unit, Institute #of Molecular Bioscience, and the Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation, at the University of Queensland, 
  #local and national twin registries at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute and Twin Research Australia, as #well as the many assessments made available by researchers worldwide, and
  #iv) was established with the purpose of promoting the conduct of health-related research in adolescence.
