The Queensland Twin Adolescent Brain Project, a longitudinal study of adolescent brain development. Manuscript submitted for publication. 
When acknowledging the QTAB project studies should consider including the following: 
  #The QTAB project resource was produced as a result of i) the goodwill and contribution of 422 twin/triplet participants and their parents, 
  #ii) funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council, Australia (APP1078756) and the Queensland Brain Institute, University of Queensland,
  #iii) access to several key resources, including the Centre for Advanced Imaging, the Human Studies Unit, Institute of Molecular Bioscience, and the Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation, at the University of Queensland, 
  #local and national twin registries at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute and Twin Research Australia, as well as the many assessments made available by researchers worldwide, and
  #iv) was established with the purpose of promoting the conduct of health-related research in adolescence.
